In  order to compile, from the checkout directory, run the following

aclocal
libtoolize
automake --add-missing
autoreconf
./configure
make

create a conf file named tdnf.conf under \etc\tdnf with the following content

[main]
gpgcheck=1
installonly_limit=3
clean_requirements_on_remove=true
repodir=/etc/yum.repos.d
cachedir=/var/cache/tdnf

.repo format of dnf/yum.
