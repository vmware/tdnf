In order to compile tdnf, run the following commands in a clone of this
directory.

$ aclocal
$ libtoolize
$ automake --add-missing
$ autoreconf
$ ./configure
$ make -j

tdnf needs its configuration file in /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf in order to function.
An example is included below:

[main]
gpgcheck=1
installonly_limit=3
clean_requirements_on_remove=true
repodir=/etc/yum.repos.d
cachedir=/var/cache/tdnf

As with dnf and yum, repository files should be placed in the repodir specified
in the above configuration file. The default location for these files is
/etc/yum.repos.d.

To test that tdnf is working, run `./tools/cli/tdnf list`. It will print out
a list of the packages you have installed and basic information about them.
